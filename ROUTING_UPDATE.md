# Routing Update - Home Page & Playground

## What Changed

The application now has proper routing with a landing page and separate playground:

### Routes
- **`/`** (localhost:3000) - Beautiful landing page with features, testimonials, and pricing
- **`/playground`** - The main coding playground (previously at root)
- **`/share/:shareId`** - Shared project view (still works as before)

### New Files Created

1. **`packages/frontend/src/pages/Home.tsx`**
   - Landing page with hero section
   - Features showcase
   - Testimonials
   - Pricing plans
   - Call-to-action sections
   - Professional footer

2. **`packages/frontend/src/pages/Playground.tsx`**
   - Moved all playground functionality here
   - Maintains all existing features (collaboration, AI, etc.)

3. **`packages/frontend/src/components/ui/Button.tsx`**
   - Reusable button component
   - Supports variants: default, outline, ghost
   - Supports sizes: default, lg
